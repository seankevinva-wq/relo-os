## Transcript

**Jam Anderson** `00:00:00`
> Get of the chair and get out of the house, because if not, yeah, I usually go as soon as I wake up, like, yeah, I think it's the best time, but I failed at that today, so, let's see here, I see you got into Trello, I did, yes, thanks for setting it up, yes.

> All right, see them joining.

> Hey, Jim, how are you?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:00:56`
> Good, how are you?

**Jam Anderson** `00:00:57`
> Good, nice to see you, happy Friday.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:00:59`
> Good Monday.

> Very

> Happy Friday.

> Bidopan, thank you for jumping on.

**Bitopan Das** `00:01:04`
> Thanks, Tim.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:01:07`
> It's kind of the middle of the night for him.

> But Bidopan, I meant to mention this call with you this morning on our software call, and I forgot all about it.

> So my apologies.

> Next time, I'll make sure I get it to you well in advance.

**Bitopan Das** `00:01:19`
> No, we should have done, Tim.

> Thanks.

**Jam Anderson** `00:01:21`
> Hi, Bidopan.

> Sorry for the last-minute-ness, and thanks for joining, and we'll make this as painless as possible for you.

**Bitopan Das** `00:01:30`
> It's all right.

**Jam Anderson** `00:01:32`
> Thanks.

> Hey, Hey, how's it going?

> Good.

> How are you?

**Nick Walsh** `00:01:37`
> Doing well, thank you.

**Jam Anderson** `00:01:38`
> Good, good.

> Well, let me introduce you guys to Kevin.

> Kevin's been with me for quite a while over at JMAI, and he's awesome because I try really hard to make AI automations, but at some point, my technical abilities stopped me.

> So I'm happy I found Kevin to help us bring it all the way through.

> Perfect.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:01:58`
> Nice you.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:01:59`
> Nice to meet you.

> Nice to meet you.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:02:00`
> Nice to meet you.

**Jam Anderson** `00:02:02`
> Kevin is coming to us from Malta, so we have people from all over the world on this call.

**Nick Walsh** `00:02:07`
> I love it.

> Wow.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:02:08`
> Fabulous.

**Jam Anderson** `00:02:09`
> Yeah.

> Well, great.

> Well, the point of this call today, I know we talked about a couple, like, AI agents that we could build for you to kind of help make your lives a little easier.

> And so Bitopan and Kevin, was hoping, you know, we could kind of just talk about the technical side and make sure that whatever we want to build could kind of integrate into your amazing system that I know that you've built for these guys.

> So, yeah.

> Kevin, did you want to start by just kind of asking any questions you might have?

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:02:44`
> Yeah.

> Yeah.

> So first of all, nice to meet you guys.

> What I would like, what would be super useful is if you could give me like a quick instrumental overview, I guess, of what happens on both sides of the equation when someone needs a mover.

> Like.

> What you're doing manually, what the system does, what would be, in an ideal world, the whole process that we're building a system around.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:03:08`
> Sure.

> So if you guys don't mind, I'll jump on that one.

> And first, I'll talk it, Kevin, kind of just give you a high overview of who we are, what we do, how we do it, and then I'll do a quick show and tell.

> I'll actually show you the different processes that occur, and then, and then, you know, we can talk about kind of what might be low-hanging fruit.

> You'll certainly be, you'll be able to identify things more, more clearly than, than we are.

> You know, the only one that's technical here, aside from, you know, you and Jam or Bitopan, everybody else is just kind of talks technology and software.

> But we're really, when you, when you dig down, we, we don't know what the hell we're doing, but we've been successful despite ourselves.

> So what we do is we have an itchy business that...

> Services the moving industry.

> And so, and it's generally for household good moving.

> And so when, when, when companies, sometimes it's private transfers, people paying for their own move, but oftentimes it's government or military or corporate relocations.

> And so a company will be paying for relocation.

> And so there is a house that is off that it needs to be, you know, surveyed to determine what, you know, what kind of truck they're going to need, packing, et cetera.

> And so we're generally hired by moving and storage companies or relocation management firms.

> And we handle things that they are not good at, or they don't want the liability to handle.

> So things like pianos, things like pool tables, light fixtures that are hanging on.

> So So

> High on ceilings, artwork, statues, glass, marble, oil paintings.

> When they're dealing with appliance disconnects where there's gas lines and water lines, we do that too.

> Disconnect and reconnect appliances, fitness equipment.

> Especially in North America now, I don't know what it's like in Malta, but so often, especially COVID kind of exacerbated this.

> Created people buying all this fitness equipment and keeping in their home.

> Now they're, when they move, they're like, oh my God, there's a ton to, I don't know how to disassemble this crap.

> So that's another service that we do an awful lot of.

> So what, we've got a client portal that clients will kind of request quotes from.

> They'll, we give them username and passwords.

> They'll request quotes.

> That pops into our admin portal and in our admin portal, like our current processes, our, our customers, viewers.

> Service teams, have four people that kind of manage those new orders, and we literally will manually confirm with that transferring homeowner, and we call it the warm handoff, right?

> So, hi, this is Jim, I'm on the customer service team, the company is Relo Solutions Group, we work with your moving company, Syracuse Moving, we're going to help with the following tasks that they've assigned us to.

> We confirm, like, we answer questions, we confirm some dates, we confirm addresses, we then kind of, once all that, we get images when possible, and then we, you know, release it to be dispatched, and that's where Nick and his team work.

> And Nick will basically identify what the task is, what the request is, determine which service provider best meets that requirement in that market.

> That, um, usually, if it's, you know, fairly close, he'll

> They'll that tech, confirm they can do it, they'll then assign it to that crew and email it over to that service crew.

> Now, we also have a vendor portal where vendors can see all their orders that we've assigned to them, they can see when they're going to get paid, they can upload their images.

> But there's currently no real mobile application for our field service.

> We need to do that, we're going to be making decisions on that very shortly.

> Some vendors can use their iPad or their phone to log in and actually complete a job from site, but most don't do that.

> Most will take our PDF work order, fill out some data on that form, have the customer sign it, go back to their office, create an invoice, and then scan over or email over us that documentation later.

> , so we're kind of like where

> We're not fully functional in terms of automation with mobile applications.

> So any questions so far?

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:08:11`
> Yes, sir.

> So first of all, thank you for that.

> Very good to bring me up to speed.

> The admin portal that you mentioned and the four people that manage that, does that work well?

> Are you happy with that?

> What things could be better with that?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:08:28`
> Good questions.

> I think it does work well.

> The challenge is here, we're on February, we're going to do seven hundreds in unique service requests.

> We only have, you know, about 12 or 13 employees and only about nine or 10 actually work in, you know, processing, maybe less, eight, probably process work.

> So it becomes a little overwhelming, especially the moving business is seasonal.

> So last year we did about 10,000 service requests.

> We expect.

> We

> We're to do hopefully many more than that this year and in coming years as the company grows.

> We've got a competitor that does over $100 million in our space.

> So to have the ability to potentially for AI to create an AI auto attendant, for instance, where let's say a service came in.

> And again, I don't know what I don't know, but I'll just kind of create it in my mind.

> And a service came in, we recognize that it's a washer, gas dryer, it's a light fixture to come down, and it's three pieces of art to create for potentially an email or a text to automatically come out of our system that would say, hi, you know, Mr.

> Jones, this is Emma.

> I'm the AI service attendant on behalf of Relo Solutions Group.

> We're working with your moving company, Syracuse Moving and Storage.

> If you could.

> We understand we're going to be taking care of the following items.

> If you'd be so kind, again, we could either say, click the following link and give us pictures of these items, or if you can just click this button to call us back so we can have a conversation with.

> So, in other words, create poll, so that they're calling us rather than us keep calling them and keeping messages.

> That might be beneficial for our customer service teams.

> Nick, any other thoughts in terms of customer service right now and what they do?

**Nick Walsh** `00:10:45`
> Well, was, I definitely would like like an after hours.

> Like, you know, AI answered the phone sounds like a person can take information.

> I think that would be

> Very helpful so that we're not constantly getting called at like 9, 10 p.m.

> on a Saturday for random things.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:11:10`
> Right.

> It could be AI, like it could be a vendor calling us and saying, hey, this customer is not calling us back.

> Is it still on for tomorrow?

> It could be the customers now have received that voicemail.

> We left them earlier and they're calling after hours because they worked all day or they were traveling or got off a plane, whatever.

> And now they're calling up and we're not in and they're saying, hi, this is Mrs.

> Benghazi calling about the move you guys call me about.

> If if if the AI could recognize maybe that caller ID from their phone number and trigger it's that transfer a and literally confirm a job based on that, you know, it's after hours, the AI automatically goes on.

> Hi, Mrs.

> Benghazi.

> This is a, you know, Martha on the AI auto attendant.

> I see.

> see.

> And just so you know, we're helping, again, go through the process.

> That would be really helpful.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:12:06`
> Sweet.

> Let me share some thoughts on that.

> I think it would be super helpful.

> You mentioned the term warm handoff, right?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:12:14`
> Yes.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:12:14`
> that's the first part.

> And then there's the part where I think you're just mentioning it.

> Now it's like someone calls, it can tell them these are the details that I have confirmed for you.

> But I can also say, I would still need a few other things, the piano images, the fittings, right?

> Things that they wouldn't have given.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:12:35`
> Sure.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:12:36`
> If there's 10 items, maybe they've given six.

> So the system can chase them for the remaining four.

> Yes.

> And I think that can be done both if they, I mean, I'm thinking of what would be the most useful.

> It can be done in a situation where they call you to confirm stuff after hours.

> So it will recognize their phone numbers, see what's missing from a database and say, okay.

> These are the things I still need from you before the move next week.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:13:03`
> Yes.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:13:03`
> It can also be that you reach out, the system reaches out to them on your behalf to, I don't know, every day, it checks what's missing and reaches out to their reminder, please give us these remaining things.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:13:16`
> Yes.

> Yeah.

> And potentially, Kevin, we could turn it, you know, if we're slow, we could potentially do it more through human, you know, keep humans known.

> Um, but as, as we ramp up and kind of people are getting overwhelmed, you know, uh, trigger a, okay, now let's have AI do some of this functionality.

**Nick Walsh** `00:13:38`
> Right.

> We have three people on vacation.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:13:40`
> Right.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:13:41`
> Um, so say I, I'm going to need your guys help to relocate as soon as the order comes in, would you immediately know what you would need from me based on what I would have filled in?

> Or what someone else would have given?

> What talking me?

> Or does that change down the line?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:14:04`
> Generally, it's fairly simple questions that we ask regarding each service.

> If it's a crating, we'll ask, can we get a picture of the statue?

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:14:17`
> Do you have an approximate value?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:14:20`
> Do you know the weight of the statue?

> Where is it located currently?

> Things of that nature.

> If it's appliances, we'll ask for make and model numbers.

> We'll try to include those because our service crews will bring shipping kits to prepare them so that their drums are secure during the course of transit in the truck.

> So there's a variety of very standard questions that we ask in that order confirmation process.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:14:50`
> Okay, okay.

> A few other questions from my end.

> And the admin portal, this is maybe more of a technical question.

> Does it allow a system that is authorized to create stuff, read from it, update, and delete stuff?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:15:09`
> I'm not sure I understand that, so I'm going to turn that over a bit a bit.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:15:14`
> Yeah.

**Bitopan Das** `00:15:16`
> Kevin, can you just repeat your question?

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:15:18`
> Yeah.

> So if I have access to the system via API and I have the right authorization API keys, however, I would authenticate, would I be able to create, read, update, and delete from this CRM?

**Bitopan Das** `00:15:34`
> Yes.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:15:35`
> Okay.

**Bitopan Das** `00:15:35`
> So we have a few APIs, but if you need any specific API endpoints, then we can even build it for you.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:15:43`
> Awesome.

> Awesome.

> But I think that is what would be needed to ensure that all the records, all the information is there, getting the key data when the move is happening, who is responsible.

> Well, it would all be from this single source of truth, I guess,

> admin portal?

**Bitopan Das** `00:16:02`
> Yes.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:16:04`
> Okay.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:16:05`
> Do you want me at this point, Kevin, to kind of do the show and tell, or do you want to keep with the dialogue?

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:16:12`
> I have a few more questions.

> I would love to get into a bit more of the in-the-weed sort of stuff, but two other questions.

> The other was the mobile application and the, I guess, the questions you asked, I know vendors is the right word, the people that you get to do the actual move or how you figure out the right, I'm going to use the word vendor again, the right vendor to use for a specific move.

> And I know you mentioned that Nick does or is responsible for this.

> So I'm curious if you, or when you do this manually or within your day to day, how does that work?

> And how could an automation, system make your job easier, better, more productive?

**Nick Walsh** `00:17:01`
> So basically, the way it works right now is the job would get pushed over to Dispatch to where I would see it, I would click into the job, and then when I go down to Assigned Vendors, it creates a dropdown, it auto-populates like a dropdown of all of the vendors within that market that I could select from, and then I typically have some guys that I prefer over other guys, so I'll always call them first and see if they could handle it.

> One thing that would be helpful would be the option to turn on auto-dispatch for specific people.

> I wouldn't want it for everybody, but I'd like rules set.

> So let's say a job is a month out, it can automatically be sent to my favorite crew in that market.

> wait a say a job.

> some a so that.

> As opposed to me having to pick up the phone every time or send them an email myself, that would be helpful, but I don't, some of our competitors have auto dispatch, like when it gets really busy, they just turn on auto dispatch, and a lot of our guys don't like it because they're getting sent stuff for the next day, when they've already got a full day, and nobody's calling them to confirm if they could do it or not.

> So, it's just something that we would have to be a little bit careful with, definitely have parameters to where it has to be like a certain date range out, and it needs to, you know, we know the tech's not on vacation, like a lot of things need to be plugged in so that we're not just blindly sending it out, and, you know, assuming that they're going to see the email and get back to us before the day before the job.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:18:50`
> Additionally, related to the auto dispatch, that it's really one of our competitors has, the biggest company in our space, they don't even, we call it.

> They don't even go through the confirmation process.

> In other words, an order comes in, it recognizes a zip code, it recognizes service provider in that market and it just sends it to them.

> And these, they are vendors, right?

> For sure.

> But we call them service partners.

> So the service partners, these guys are blue collar laborers, right?

> And many of them are fairly gruff.

> And so they, you know, now our competitor is expecting these gruff, blue collar people to call these like elite corporate transferees and be like, hey, Mr.

> Smith, I'm wondering about, you know, and it just, it's a bad, it's not, it's not the vibe that we provide.

> Yeah, completely different.

**Nick Walsh** `00:19:50`
> One other thing I think would be great for automation within dispatch would be we, every morning I'm calling for service windows, asking, hey, what time are you showing up?

> So I'd love for some, you know, an AI text message just goes out to the guy and it just says, please select your service window for however many jobs you have on today.

> They just click, select the range, click, select the range, and it auto-populates back to our system.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:20:20`
> Yeah.

> When, when we do the initial confirmation process, we, we always try to set our service in conjunction with movers, crews that are, if it's an origin, in other words, they're moving out of a house.

> Normally the process is the day before they load the truck.

> There's a day of packing and preparation.

> So at origin, we usually always schedule our origin crew in conjunction with that pack and prepare preparation move crew.

> Then at destination, we always, the day after the movers deliver everything and get it in the darn house, that's when we send our crew in to do the reverse.

> So,

> So, again, these tracking down these service partners to get these service times, we provide a three-hour service window.

> So we'll say, you know, and people will be like, well, when's he going to be there?

> And if it's a week out or three days out, we'll say, well, we don't know yet.

> They're going to check their schedule and then they'll give you a three-hour service window.

> So that's how that works.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:21:26`
> There are so many things that I'm thinking that could be – anyway, so a move typically consists of a three-day period where there's the day before, the actual day where the movers go, the service partners, and the day after where you guys go in and reconnect stuff and all that.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:21:49`
> Yes.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:21:50`
> Did I get that right?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:21:50`
> Okay.

> It's really four.

> You've got the pack day where the movers are packing the shipment, the load day where they're loading the truck, then you've got the deliver day.

> And then the day after delivery is when we'll usually be out there.

**Nick Walsh** `00:22:05`
> Yeah, definitely depends on the shipment weight.

> Because sometimes they're just moving a one-bedroom apartment.

> They could pack everything, load it in one day, and then they're driving over and delivering the same day because it's a local move.

> So it really just depends on where they're moving to, the shipment weight, like how long the transit time is going to take place.

> But, yeah, most of the time it's always the day after.

> We do have some movers that request same-day service for destination if there's beds on the order so that they're not just sleeping on a mattress on the ground.

> And, yeah.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:22:46`
> Okay.

> So for the, just to go back to what you were saying, Nick, for the auto dispatch, I agree that very, sort of strict rules need to be implemented.

> But I think once those...

> Those rules are down.

> It can make your life much easier in terms of sending the request and getting a confirmation back.

> And if time is running, as in the day is coming, approaching fast and no one has yet confirmed, there's a second email, a SMS that can go out.

> That would be great.

> And you said that you would call them, like you have your favorite list of service partners that you call.

> Is it about, at the moment it's just calling and then who picks up first and can do the job, gets the job sort of thing?

**Nick Walsh** `00:23:44`
> Basically, it depends on the time crunch.

> Like if it's a job for tomorrow, I'm just going, the first person that answers and tells me that they could do it is getting the job.

> If it's a job two weeks out, I'm probably calling my favorite guy.

> If he doesn't answer, then I'm sending him a text message.

> saying, hey, I just sent you this job for two weeks out.

> Please confirm it's all right and there's no issues.

> And then he'll text me back, yep, I can cover it.

> Or, you know, no, sorry, please reassign.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:24:14`
> Mm-hmm.

> Okay, okay.

> Because I'm thinking, yeah, it could be either more flexible, I guess, or, yeah, I'm thinking it could be very flexible or very strict in the sense that it's either a step-by-step and this has to happen after another, like one step after another, or it's more who gets there first sort of gets, I'm sure there's many ways to make it efficient.

> It would be something we would have to maybe drill a bit deeper in.

**Nick Walsh** `00:24:55`
> Absolutely.

> Absolutely.

> And getting their paperwork too.

> Yeah.

> A lot of these guys just, they drag their feet trying to send their invoice and their paperwork, so it'd be great to just, rather than us constantly having to pick up the phone, we need this, we need this, we need this, it's just, AI is just keeping track of it, you know, it's been 24 hours since you completed the job, we need paperwork, it's been 48 hours since you've completed the job, you have, you now have 24 hours to send it before there's penalty, something like that.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:25:28`
> All that's true, but once we get a mobile application, our hope is, if the client has a price schedule, right, and that service partner has a price schedule, we know what we're going to pay for all these services, we know what we're going to build, then if that service partner completes the job in the field, and, you know, does it according to the process that we build in that app, so we get make and models and images, and, you know, dimensions of...

> Crates and all that's critical data and hit submit, the system should be able to create the invoice kind of automatically and also create a payable automatically.

> In other words, build that, you know, if the vendors, if the service partner's name is, you know, Jimmy Walsh Services, it should potentially, you know, use his logo and create an invoice and email it to him saying, here's your invoice for the job you did for Relo Solutions today.

> That's where we want to get to.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:26:34`
> What I was thinking is that for service partners and for clients, guess, at least my brain thinks in systems, right?

> So step one step, like all the different steps that would be needed.

> So if we take the tail end of the service partner stuff, which is, I guess, what we're speaking about here, the last thing would be invoice paid.

> The one before would be invoice generated and sent to partner with their link that they

> They can click, that they can pay.

> It's personalized and branded with their colors, with their logo.

> The one before would be, I don't know, need to contact customer.

> So there are steps that if I, if I'm a service partner, I am able to log into my app and can see number one, the jobs I need to do today with when the client is expecting me and maybe there's something like that already, but it's all sequential in that regard.

**Nick Walsh** `00:27:29`
> Right.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:27:30`
> And one final thing I wanted to mention, on the moving day, the client says, okay, your guy would be here between 12 and 3 p.m., for example.

> What happens if the client, again, I don't know if client is the right word, but if the person that's moving can do 12 to 3, does have to contact you and you contact the service partner, is there some sort of back and forth like that?

**Nick Walsh** `00:27:59`
> trouble?

> is

> The service partner is supposed to be calling the customer themselves to, like, when we ask them for a window, we are under the impression that they have already talked to the customer, set that window, and that's what they're giving us.

> So it's not, like, I guess somebody could change their mind if they say that, yeah, 12 to 3 works for me, and then, you know, all of a sudden it doesn't work for them, then they would call us, or they, you know, would call the service partner that they've been in contact with and say, hey, can we move this timing around?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:28:38`
> Honestly, what the even better process in my mind would be, once that service partner clicks his app, or whether it's from his phone or his desktop, whatever, clicks that service time, then potentially the AI, you know, hi, this is Mildred, I'm the, you know, dispatcher.

> That's Korn Agent for Relo Solutions Group.

> Great news.

> Wanted to let you know that John Smith, our service partner, will be doing your creating for between 8 a.m.

> and 11 a.m.

> Any questions?

> Call us.

> You know, so it texts with maybe a WAV file, or it just, I don't know, that's just my thought, is that we create that push so that service provider doesn't need to call the customer anymore.

> It creates it on his behalf, saving him time.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:29:35`
> What I was thinking is, there's a common webpage, a common page on the mobile app eventually, where all three parties, i.e.

> you, the service partner, and the client have visibility.

> If someone wants to change something, it's all done there.

> So no, the guy doesn't need to call Mrs.

> Smith, like as we were saying before.

> And back and forth, back and forth involving, I'm sure involving you sometimes when it, you shouldn't, or it's not, I don't want to say it's a waste of your time, but as you, I think you mentioned, it should be between the other two parties involved and you would step in if and when needed.

**Nick Walsh** `00:30:20`
> Yes.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:30:21`
> So you would have visibility over the whole thing and can step in if needed, but everyone would also, like if, I don't know, if the guy gets a puncture and needs to shift, I don't know, if that's a situation, but, and needs to shift by two hours, he'd be able to message the person through the app, i.e.

> he has options to.

**Nick Walsh** `00:30:42`
> That would be amazing, what would be even, what would be great on top of that too, is if our actual client, the moving company, not the end customer, but the moving company could almost get visibility to that as well, because it's still like, it's just a domino effect.

> They tell us, we have to tell the movers, so if everybody could see the same thing, oh, they get a link for this job, whatever, and it's just the whole communication, and they get a little notification, and it's like, hey, a change request has been made, and they can pop it open, see what's going on, so that we're not having to update our mover as well, because half these movers are like, I mean, I think something could change by two hours.

> And it's okayed by the customer, but some of these movers are like, you didn't tell us that, and this and that, and they feel like they need to know every little thing that's going on.

**Jam Anderson** `00:31:42`
> Yes.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:31:43`
> And one final thing.

> I guess eventually, if there's a mobile app, it would involve some additional, I guess, complexity, but would it be helpful if there's one central visibility panel for everyone involved, for the customer to see where they move.

> Where is that as well, from a sort of GPS point of view, or would that be open up a can of worms that?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:32:09`
> It might open up a can of worms.

> In other words, if they could see where our service partner is and I'm not sure.

**Nick Walsh** `00:32:18`
> There's a part of me that loves that.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:32:20`
> And a part of me that, you know, because sometimes these crews will like all of a sudden they say they're going to be at our job between eight.

> No, uh, say 11 and two.

> And all of a sudden they, they, they get a call from someone else and says, no, I need you originally.

> And they do another job.

> They fill one in before our job, making our job run late.

> And if, if people could track that venture and see that they're kind of going the wrong way, it might be bad, but I'm not sure.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:32:51`
> Fair enough.

> Fair enough.

> Okay.

**Nick Walsh** `00:32:52`
> I mean, maybe when you hit, you know, they hit I'm on the way, then you can track it.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:32:57`
> Hmm.

**Nick Walsh** `00:33:01`
> Rather than just being able to track their location throughout the whole day, if they've got like a two to five service window, then they can't be pulling it up at 8am and seeing where they're at.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:33:11`
> Yeah.

> Okay.

> Yeah.

> Just a thought.

> I don't think it would be one of the first things implemented, but okay.

> I mean, from my end, if we could maybe go a bit into the admin panel, have a look at that, that would be awesome.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:33:28`
> I'll first, if you don't mind, show you the client portal, you know, where the clients would place an order.

> Then I'll go to the admin.

> Then I'll go to the service partner just because that's where my brain is thinking here.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:33:40`
> Yes.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:33:40`
> I'll share a screen here.

> Video, where it will come through, where's the share button here?

> Oh, there it is.

> Share, I think, this is it.

**Nick Walsh** `00:33:57`
> Yeah.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:34:00`
> Okay.

> You see my mouse?

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:34:03`
> Loading.

**Jam Anderson** `00:34:05`
> Loading up.

> Okay.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:34:07`
> Yes.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:34:08`
> Okay.

> So I'm logged in right now as one of our clients.

> This is Jade Cogswell.

> She works.

> She's a customer service manager at Syracuse and Moving and Storage.

> So we're logged in as her.

> So today she can, there's eight orders that her company, so she can either view her individual orders.

> And by the way, this runs a lot slower because we're in this environment.

> So she can review her individual orders or all her company orders.

> She has about, I don't know, eight people in her customer service team that work for her.

> She's the manager.

> Okay.

> So these are the today's jobs.

> She can call.

> Kind of open them up, see what's on them.

> She can review like they, their processes, they get estimates.

> So I can go into estimates because normally what happens, they're, they're mainly a corporate mover is.

> So if they're doing a job for Google, for instance, and it's a, it's an employee relocating from New York City to Seattle, in addition to their move estimate, they get any other ancillary services, we'd be considered a third party or ancillary service.

> So they'll get the quote related to our services, then add it on to the other charges, and then submit what the total estimate is to Google.

> Once they get approval, they'll then go back to their whoever their partners are, they might have an auto shipping company, they have a company like us, and they'll go into that unique order, like this one is transferring is they.

> The is Reynolds.

> They're going from Sacramento, California to Anaheim, California.

> So this is a, you know, San Francisco to L.A.

> basically.

> And this is the transfer details.

> This is where they're going from and to.

> This is when the pack, the load, the delivery dates.

> This is what's on the order.

> So removing a TV from the wall, creating a TV and then the trip charge to get our crew out there.

> You basically have the same services at origin and destination.

> So if she knew that this job was ready to book, she can hit just place as order.

> And or she and then once she does, she can edit and or append anything.

> If the dates changed or anything, she can make changes in that regard.

> So I'm not going to mess with any of her orders.

> I'll just look at maybe another couple jobs.

> Here's one.

> This one's

> Okay, just in going from Nashville, Tennessee, it's a Yale University to local Peloton bike disassembly, electric dryer, washer, that's that job.

> So they can also manage their orders.

> They can view all their completed orders.

> Then she can manage her unique profile here, her name, how do you like to be confirmed, communicated with, email, cell, work phone.

> What do you like copies of, order acknowledgement, order completed, invoice copy.

> You can kind of manage unique individuals.

> We give them some ability to we can communicate as much or as little as they want once they place an order.

> We assign price books.

> So these.

> that's when

> These are the price books that are assigned to this, so these are some of their corporate accounts, so Black & Decker, Travelers Insurance, Carrier Corporation, Yale University, RTX is this huge global defense contractor.

> So we have unique price books for all their different accounts.

> Any other things you want to see on the client portal at this point?

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:38:27`
> Quick question, Jimmy.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:38:28`
> So this Jade, this lady Jade, who is she again?

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:38:33`
> She has her own company.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:38:35`
> So let me just...

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:38:37`
> I'm trying to understand who are the stakeholders, I guess, in the whole process.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:38:46`
> So Jade is a...

> Syracuse Moving is a moving company, they're an allied van line moving company.

> This is their facility in Connecticut.

> She works there and she runs their customers.

> The service department.

> And they're a, you know, they're a huge moving company.

> Even though they only have one location, they have like 60 over the road tractor trailer drivers that work for them.

> And they only mainly do corporate relocation.

> So Jade is an employee of this company.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:39:21`
> And this is a service partner.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:39:23`
> This is a client.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:39:25`
> A client.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:39:25`
> Yes.

> Yep.

> So this is where we, where we are here is the client portal for one of our clients.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:39:35`
> I guess what I'm not understanding is, so if I need to relocate because I got a job offer somewhere else.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:39:45`
> Yep.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:39:47`
> I would contact you or would I contact Jade and her company?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:39:52`
> It could be either.

> So sometimes we'll do, we call it COD.

> So people will find out about our.

> We'll It's On no,

> Because we're not a moving company, we only do unique services for the industry, so we don't do any transportation, but if people have artwork and they want us to pack it, we'll do that, if they have a piano that needs preparation, we'll do that, if they have fitness equipment, they need disassembled and prepared for a move, we'll do that, then typically they have a moving company they work with, and we'll work in conjunction with that moving company.

**Nick Walsh** `00:40:30`
> Yeah, most of the time the movers are who we have set rates with, I'd say 90% of the jobs we get in are from the moving company rather than a person themselves.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:40:40`
> Yeah, most of our business is B2B, we do 2% of our revenue is B2C.

**Nick Walsh** `00:40:46`
> So the person would reach out to the mover, and the mover would realize, oh wait, they've got a multi-station home gym in their house, our guys won't handle that, they've got this, this and that.

> Then they reach out to us, hey, we

> You a quote for, can you put in this estimate or can you place an order for, you know, a bunk bed disassembly, a chandelier takedown, pool table disassembly, et cetera.

> So it's actually most of the time the mover that's requesting or putting the job in.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:41:17`
> I'll jump to our admin portal now, if you don't mind.

> Okay, so this is where all the employees of Relo Solutions work, right?

> So first I'll show you like the customer service tab.

> So these are orders that have come in recently that popped into customer service.

> And again, our process is clients get a quote, you know, it becomes an, it's an estimate that sits there until they hit place order.

> Once they hit place order, it pops in here.

> So now I have four people in customer service.

> Who's.

> The is to review these new orders, and let's look at some of these orders.

> So this one has we're creating something, building a box, a wooden box.

> Here is we're taking down a TV.

**Nick Walsh** `00:42:15`
> Here is we're disconnecting appliances.

> a TV, uncrating and putting up a TV.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:42:19`
> Okay, here we're disconnecting appliances.

> This one we're building a bunch of, they're going internationally, so they're moving from the United States somewhere internationally, and it requires certain crates that have a specific wood.

> So we're using this ISPM wood.

> Here we're disassembling what's called a sleep number bed.

> Here is a couple crates.

> Here is we're doing one crate.

> Here is appliance disconnect.

> Here is taking down a bunch of TVs.

> Here is appliance disconnect.

> Here is a bed.

> Here Here is these are the...

> The niche services that we do for mainly for moving companies throughout the United States.

> And you can see that it is really throughout the United States, New York, Oklahoma, Massachusetts, Maryland, Virginia, Texas, Georgia, Vermont, Arizona, South Carolina, Tennessee, et cetera.

> So our people will, our current process is, let's say, for instance, I'm going to open just one order.

> So our current process is someone in customer service will then call Caleb McCannan and say, hi, Mr.

> McCannan.

> This is Rebecca.

> I'm with Relo Solutions Group.

> We're working in conjunction with your moving company called Syracuse Moving.

> How are you today?

> Da, da, da.

> Cheers.

> What we're helping with is we're going to be doing, we're going to be taking down your TV that's on the sheetrock wall and we're going to be packing it.

> And then when you get to your destination in, where's he moving from?

> Oh, maybe.

> Oh, okay.

> This, I pulled up a destination order.

> So this is, in this case, his origin has already been performed.

> So we took down his TV in Huntsville, Alabama, packed it up.

> Now we're at destination, trying to schedule, to put it, like to unpack it out of the box or crate and put it back on his wall in Tucson.

> So what we'll do is just kind of, we understand you're moving to 7355 South Wilma.

> It wrote apartment 4104.

> Is that correct?

> Is that a subdivision or development?

> Is there a gate code?

> And the movers are scheduled to deliver on March 3rd, March 2nd.

> Is that correct?

> Well, we can be out there the very next day.

> We just confirm that.

> We answer any questions.

> Then we hit confirmed with customers.

> So we change the status up here to confirmed.

> And then once we change that status, it then drops to this dispatch where these are new orders or all orders in dispatch.

> And in dispatch, it will pop into this unassigned tab.

> So once it's confirmed, this is where Nick and his team say, okay, these are orders that need to be assigned to vendors.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:45:52`
> Yep.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:45:53`
> So Nick will, for instance, open up this, this one randomly here.

> you.

**Nick Walsh** `00:45:59`
> .

> .

> That one must have just came through.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:46:02`
> Okay.

> And so this one's going in, you know, Nick can view a map, see where in Massachusetts this job is going.

> I don't know how fast.

**Nick Walsh** `00:46:11`
> Can you guys see a map?

> Yep.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:46:13`
> Okay.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:46:14`
> You can see whereabouts in the state it is.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:46:21`
> And this is where you would find your people based on the ones that might get the job done, the ones that you prefer, where you give them a call and say, are you available next month on this date for this move?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:46:35`
> Exactly.

> Yeah.

**Nick Walsh** `00:46:36`
> For this one, I would see it's right on the Massachusetts, New Hampshire line, right on the border.

> And I know that I have a crew right across the border in New Hampshire, and I would say they're closest to it.

> So I'm going to give it to them.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:46:49`
> This is the services.

> Now, Nick will go down to here.

> He'll hit.

> Oh, are there no vendors now?

> Where's the?

> Vendors section.

> Oh, here.

> Select vendors within territories.

> And the ones that are highlighted are the ones that are preferred in these markets.

> So he could then just click on this one.

> If it's within a few days, he usually calls.

> But if not, he could just click on it and then hit assigned to tech.

> And then it would email over the work order.

> So basically, every service partner that we have, when we set them up with their, you know, their company name, their address, their tax ID, their, we then individual users at their company, we then build their territory.

> OK, what area can you cover for us?

> So it's, you know, within each state, we'll say, OK, what counties do you cover?

> Or, you know, counties will populate the appropriate zip code.

> So, you know, we're here in New York State, we're in Onondaga County, it will, if you click New York, Onondaga, it adds every town with the appropriate zip code in Onondaga.

> So that's how we build profiles.

> Some of these techs work, you know, in like Rhode Island, very small state with a few counties, but they'll cover Connecticut, they'll cover Massachusetts, so that we can build, you know, potentially have three states being covered by an individual service partner.

> Any other questions about like, I can, you we showed you customer service, we showed you how we dispatch jobs.

> There is like a quality assurance function that maybe could be, we have when a job is marked as service complete, it sends out an email to that customer saying, hey, please rate the service that you just received.

> That could certainly be automated.

> That could go out as a, an AI, like a text.

> One.

> One.

> .

> Here.

> On Aaron.

> Mathematically, because again, I think most of these younger people respond way better to text than they do to email.

> And so I think we could we could automate that to be a text where they can respond.

> You know, if the text would say, please rate your, you know, crater, whatever, and they could then, you know, on a scale of one to five, the net promoter score, they could make a selection, they could hit a speaker, they could do a WAV file and it's submit.

> These are two that just came in.

> So these are the last 30 days, again, a scale of one to five, how the transferees are rating us, you know, it's amazing, our, our crews get really highly rated.

> So literally, in the, in the last 30 days, we've only have one score of a four, all the rest are five.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:49:52`
> Nice.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:49:53`
> Which is pretty amazing, actually, 4.95 in the last 30 days.

> Now, again, we only have.

> Probably 5% response rate out of all the jobs we did, because I'd love to get a higher percent.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:50:08`
> the request for reviews, is that one email fits all sort of thing at the moment?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:50:15`
> What we do, and Bitopan built this recently, is if a review comes back either as a four or five, our system will trigger another email that will say thank you so much for responding to the crew.

> We're really proud of them.

> Would you please be so kind as to give a Google review?

> And so, you know, if greater than four or five, otherwise we don't ask them to do a Google review if they think we stink.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:50:44`
> Yes, makes sense.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:50:47`
> Okay.

> And also, you know, in our admin portal, we build like, this is where we set up clients, right?

> Or prospects.

> We'll put them in here.

> here.

> does.

> over must be.

> That's Gary

> And we can do it by, you know, by the company name, so you can click alphabetically, and once we build a moving company's profile, we assign price books.

> So this is the parades that we'll use for the work that you provide kind of thing.

> Then, you know, vendors, again, the same thing.

> These are our service partners.

> Again, we should probably change that tab to say that, but, you know, you can, I'll just go into one, I always like to pick on Rocky.

> So here's just a, you know, this is a small company in New Hampshire that covers New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

> So you can see.

> The greater market, Boston, Cambridge, Newton, these are the states they cover.

> They're based in Salem, New Hampshire.

> We consider them a full service third party.

> Some of our vendors are very, you know, service item specific.

> They might be clock people.

> They might be billiard service companies.

> They may be crating only.

> They may be, you know, fitness only.

> Full service means that they have our ability to do a variety of services.

> So, we categorize them appropriately.

> We build their price books.

> As customers request estimates, as our clients request estimates, this is where the app, there's an estimate button here.

> So we currently have 1,437 open estimates that have been, you know, people have logged in and requested quotes.

> Does that you have?

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:52:58`
> Does that mean that you have?

> So haven't responded or that you responded and they haven't got back to you or one or the other?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:53:04`
> Yeah, they got their price back from us when they requested the quote.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:53:09`
> They got a PDF with the quote estimate, but they haven't placed it as an order yet.

> And is there a full-op system there if they haven't, but you've sent something?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:53:18`
> Yeah, what we do is every Monday morning, there's a Monday morning report.

> It's a PDF that will go out to all users that will say, we call it the open estimate.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:53:30`
> And there's hyperlinks there.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:53:33`
> So we'll say, hey, dear Kevin, I hope you had a great weekend.

> Happy Monday.

> Here's your open estimates with Relo Solutions Group.

> Please feel free to manage from the links below, right?

> And then you can then see, oh, shoot, you know, I've got Jim Walsh job that's coming up.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:53:49`
> I got to place that as an order.

> Okay.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:53:51`
> Click on that hyperlink and, you know, move it along.

> Okay.

> There's also a billing process here.

> So right now our process.

> This is once these vendors complete a job, again, they'll literally email us their invoice with the signature copy with job images, and then we take all that and we attach it to a job, and we then mark it as done, ready to bill.

> There's none there currently, but here's the all ones that are completed and we don't have paperwork yet.

> So these are by vendor, those are all the orders.

> This is kind of, you know, jobs, our billing team is in the process of billing.

> So I'll show you just one of them here.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:54:50`
> I have one.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:54:54`
> So this move, this tech was, it's called Baystate, the service partner.

> So.

> So.

> We can see, I'll go down here and look at what he sent to us.

> So this is the order that we emailed him.

> This is some of the comments he made while he was out on the job site.

> You know, in terms of these are some of the dimensions.

> He got a signature there.

> Now here's his invoice to us.

> Now our billing team will review all this and build a job and create the payable.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:55:41`
> Okay.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:55:42`
> Again, we hope to automate that once we go and look back.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:55:52`
> Question for Nick, maybe.

> One before we were saying like chasing people to submit.

> Let's started.

> The remaining four items out of the 10.

> Would that happen as soon as a dispatch order is created?

> Is that when you would call the people and then you're like, please send me these 10 items and then the follow up would need to happen?

**Nick Walsh** `00:56:17`
> That would be more so after the job is completed.

> Are you saying for service windows?

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:56:23`
> For the piano images and television images.

**Nick Walsh** `00:56:27`
> That would be as a, as it stands right now, when we get the mobile app running, it's going to have them take those and it will auto submit as they're, you know, as they're working on that item.

> But right now they just submit that once the job's completed and they typically get home for the night, finish all their jobs for the day, then they'll sit down and they'll generate invoices and their paperwork and they'll submit all their pictures from the job.

> And send that to our billing team so that we could build the job.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:57:00`
> Maybe I didn't explain myself correctly.

> The customers themselves, I think you mentioned.

**Nick Walsh** `00:57:07`
> yeah.

> So customer service would be asking them for, you know, make and model images if they can.

> Yeah.

> So when the job is placed, then, well, typically they ask before then, but certainly when the job is placed, it would be nice if we're missing those fields to have AI, you know, follow up, send some emails or texts saying, hey, we still haven't heard back from you on the make and model of this, you know, whatever the case may be.

> Yeah, absolutely.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:57:40`
> Okay.

> Okay.

> Thank you for the walkthrough as well.

**Nick Walsh** `00:57:45`
> Very helpful.

> Sorry.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:57:48`
> Sure.

> Anything else you'd like to see in the admin portal?

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:57:51`
> I think not at this stage.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:57:53`
> think.

> Okay.

> I have, you know, there are, there's also the, the, the vendor portal.

> Yeah.

> I don't know if you want to see that now or not.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:58:02`
> Sure.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:58:03`
> Okay, bear with me.

> So I'm going to just go to vendors.

> Nick, who's a vendor that has a bunch of work right now?

**Nick Walsh** `00:58:16`
> Probably Gary.

> Okay.

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:58:27`
> So I'm going to go into this vendor.

> He's done 2,841 jobs for us.

> So I'll log in as the owner.

> Okay, so this is the vendor portal.

> So there's 15 active jobs.

> There's only one going on today.

> There's two for tomorrow.

> There's three jobs.

> So these are the 15 jobs, so you know, it is, hey, we're looking for him to set a service time on this.

> These are two for tomorrow.

> So this is like it queues up potentially tasks for him, right?

> So if we want to look at today's work, this is the job that he's on for today.

> We see it's between set for between 9am and 11am.

> So this would pop up if he was like, are you on site or not?

> Right, if he happened to log in.

> And I don't know if he is, so I'm not going to say he is.

**Kevin Farrugia** `00:59:51`
> So what happens if he says I'm on site?

> What does that affect?

**Jimmy Walsh** `00:59:58`
> Um, it would just

> Just, uh, what would do that do, Bitopan?

> It would just change the status to be tech on site.

**Bitopan Das** `01:00:11`
> I'm not sure whether tech was already assigned or not, but as this is today's job, I guess tech should already be assigned, and the next step should be the report on site.

> And once the job is done, um, they will simply click on the close out button once that is done.

**Jimmy Walsh** `01:00:33`
> Yeah.

**Kevin Farrugia** `01:00:34`
> Okay.

**Jimmy Walsh** `01:00:34`
> Um, so yeah, today, this is what he's, you know, step one is to accept a job, um, step two is, okay, you, you know, it's, the job's coming up, set that three hour service window, and once you do so, which crew are you assigning?

> So, um, so, you know, some of these people have three and four and five and six people that are running.

> And trucks for them.

> So we want to know who is going to be the lead service technician on the job site that then what, you know, once that service partner is that is on site, we want to know it.

> And then, as Bitopan mentioned, when they're done, we want them to close out job complete, essentially.

**Kevin Farrugia** `01:01:20`
> Makes sense.

**Jimmy Walsh** `01:01:21`
> OK, yeah.

> And here we can put some instructional videos, we can put You know, this is his jobs that have QA scores, 127.

> And then if I go to his main profile.

> See, he's done 2,603 jobs for us.

> Out of that, 614 have returned quality assurance scores.

> And his current QA score is 4.8 with us.

**Kevin Farrugia** `01:01:57`
> Yes.

**Jimmy Walsh** `01:01:58`
> Yes.

> Yeah.

> OK.

> Nice, okay.

> That is basically the typical vendor portal.

> So I'll just go back out to admin, and I'm going to probably hit stop sharing now.

**Kevin Farrugia** `01:02:19`
> Yeah.

**Jimmy Walsh** `01:02:20`
> Okay.

> If I can find where that is.

**Jam Anderson** `01:02:25`
> Thanks for showing us all of this, guys.

> From our original conversation, I was all excited about the opportunity.

> And we still are, of course, but definitely looking into all the different layers of the complexity for each part was really good to do.

**Jimmy Walsh** `01:02:45`
> We got in the weeds today.

**Jam Anderson** `01:02:46`
> We did.

> Yes.

**Kevin Farrugia** `01:02:50`
> Yes.

> For my end, mean, yeah, thank you for that super helpful.

> I mean, is there anything else that we should know?

> Well, I guess I did.

**Jimmy Walsh** `01:03:05`
> I don't think so.

> Again, Bitopan wasn't even brief to this.

> Bitopan, Jam, Jam Anderson's company is that, you know, she is an AI consultant and has an AI kind of small business implementation company.

> And Kevin is one of her associates that is, you know, works with small business to implement AI.

> And our thought here in this consulting relationship is to determine what are some of the processes within our Relo platform, which is so darn good, that can be improved through effective AI implementation.

> So that's the nature of this relationship.

**Jam Anderson** `01:03:52`
> Yeah.

> Thanks for saying that, Jim.

> And I just want to reiterate, when we create the blueprint, it's not to.

> you later.

> Replace anything, it's just to, you know, add automation to the system and Bitopan, like, whatever feedback you have, there's probably a lot of things in this platform where you can give feedback and say, oh, like, we can, you could help with a certain aspect.

> So we definitely want to partner with you and work together on this.

**Jimmy Walsh** `01:04:19`
> Yeah.

**Kevin Farrugia** `01:04:21`
> Yeah.

**Jimmy Walsh** `01:04:22`
> Okay.

**Kevin Farrugia** `01:04:23`
> From my end.

> Yeah, so I'll go away.

> I'll review the transcript of the call, come up with opportunities that I think would be super valuable based on what we discussed.

> And then, I mean, if we can maybe have a follow-up session where we can present the stuff, the roadmap, how we would potentially set it up, the roadmap would be yours to follow, generally, as in, the ideas are there if you wanted to implement them.

> And then, if we decide to move forward, we can also do that.

**Jimmy Walsh** `01:04:59`
> Okay.

> Okay.

> Okay.

> Yeah, and Bitopan, would you please put in chat your email address here, Kevin, if you need to email Bitopan Direct for any like more specific platform questions, I'll let you two geeks deal with that directly, no offense.

**Kevin Farrugia** `01:05:17`
> It's compliment at this stage, yeah.

**Jimmy Walsh** `01:05:19`
> I think it is.

**Nick Walsh** `01:05:21`
> Yeah, definitely.

> Kevin, are you a streamer?

> You got the whole streamer set up.

**Kevin Farrugia** `01:05:25`
> I have a YouTube channel that I record AI videos for, but there's so much stuff happening.

**Nick Walsh** `01:05:31`
> But yes, that's the idea behind the whole thing.

> Nice.

**Jam Anderson** `01:05:35`
> But you're not a gamer.

**Kevin Farrugia** `01:05:37`
> No, no, I was never, no.

**Jimmy Walsh** `01:05:40`
> Nick is.

> Yeah, I am.

**Nick Walsh** `01:05:43`
> Not, not since, not since we got a little boy now, so I haven't played since before that, but.

**Jimmy Walsh** `01:05:53`
> But now you have to grow up.

**Jam Anderson** `01:05:55`
> Yeah.

**Nick Walsh** `01:05:56`
> Until he's, until he's older, then I'll be playing video games with him.

**Jam Anderson** `01:05:59`
